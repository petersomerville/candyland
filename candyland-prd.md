**Document Version:** 1.3
**Date Created:** 2025-04-04
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-02
**Author(s):** Peter Somerville
**Target Audience:** AI Code Generation Agent (Python Focus)
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Overview / Purpose

**1.1. Product Summary:**
This document outlines the requirements for a digital, web-based version of the board game, Candyland. The game should be playable within a standard desktop web browser using keyboard and mouse input. It must support 2, 3, or 4 players playing locally ("hotseat" mode) on the same computer. The implementation must replicate all core rules, mechanics, and components of the standard Candyland board game.

**1.2. Business Context:**
The goal is to create an accessible and engaging digital experience. This product serves as a demonstration of board game logic in a web environment using Python, potentially acting as a portfolio piece.

**1.3. Goals:**

- **G1: Functional Equivalence:** Replicate the gameplay experience of the physical Candyland board game accurately.
- **G2: User Experience:** Provide a clear, intuitive, and visually appealing interface for players on a desktop browser.
- **G3: Technical Implementation:** Deliver a robust, well-structured Python application suitable for web deployment.
- **G4: Player Support:** Enable 2, 3, or 4 players to participate in a single game session locally.

**1.4. Success Metrics:**

- **SM1: Game Completion Rate:** >95% of started games can be played to a valid conclusion without critical game-breaking bugs related to core mechanics.
- **SM2: Rule Accuracy:** 100% adherence to the defined Candyland rules (see Functional Requirements & Appendix). Zero deviations in movement, card effects, or win conditions.
- **SM3: Player Count Functionality:** Games successfully start and run to completion with 2, 3, and 4 players.
- **SM4: Code Quality:** Generated Python code is readable, modular, commented, and follows standard Python best practices (PEP 8). Includes basic unit tests for core game logic (e.g., movement calculations, win condition checks).

## 2. Problem Statement / Background

**2.1. Problem:**
The physical Candyland board game requires players to be in the same location, possess the physical board and pieces, and manually manage game setup and rules. Pieces can be lost, and setup takes time. A digital version overcomes these limitations, offering convenience and accessibility.

**2.2. Background:**
Candyland is a widely recognized, simple racing board game primarily played by young children. Its core mechanics involve drawing colored cards and moving a pawn to the corresponding colored space on the board. There is no strategy involved; it relies purely on luck of the draw. Its simplicity makes it a good candidate for digital adaptation.

**2.3. Competitive Analysis:**
While various digital board games exist, and potentially other Candyland implementations, this project focuses on a specific implementation targeted for generation by an AI using Python and standard web technologies, emphasizing faithful reproduction of the classic rules in a local multiplayer context.

## 3. Scope

**3.1. In Scope (Release 1.0):**

- **Core Game Logic:**
  - Accurate representation of the standard Candyland board path (~134 spaces), including all standard colors (Red, Purple, Yellow, Blue, Orange, Green) in sequence.
  - Implementation of all standard single and double color cards.
  - Implementation of all standard picture cards (Peppermint Forest, Gumdrop Mountain, Lollipop Woods, Ice Cream Sea, Gingerbread Tree, Gloppy the Molasses Monster) and their corresponding board locations.
  - Correct movement rules: forward to the _next_ space for single colors, forward to the _second_ space for double colors, directly to the _picture space_ (forward or backward) for picture cards.
  - Implementation of the "Stuck in the Molasses Swamp" (or equivalent, e.g., Gloppy) space: If a player lands here, they lose their next turn. (Note: Some modern versions replace this with a picture card leading _to_ the space, which acts like any other picture card. **Requirement:** Implement the "Lose a Turn" mechanic if landing on the designated space _or_ if drawing the Gloppy picture card, based on classic rules. Clarify which rule version if ambiguous - _assume landing on the specific 'Molasses' square triggers 'Lose a Turn'_. Assume the Gloppy _card_ moves you _to_ that square.)
  - Implementation of shortcut paths (e.g., Rainbow Trail, Gumdrop Pass): If a player lands _exactly_ on the start space of a shortcut, they immediately move to the end space of that shortcut.
  - Standard card deck composition (specific card counts needed - see Functional Requirements).
  - Card drawing mechanic (one card per turn).
  - Deck reshuffling when the draw pile is empty.
- **Player Management:**
  - Support for 2, 3, or 4 human players playing on the same machine ("hotseat" mode).
  - Ability for players to select the number of players at the start of the game.
  - Assignment of distinct player pawns (e.g., different colors or shapes).
  - Clear turn indication (highlighting the active player).
  - Sequential turn progression.
- **Game Flow:**
  - Game setup screen (select player count).
  - Main game screen displaying the board, pawns, player information, card deck/discard area, and action buttons.
  - Win condition: First player to reach or pass the final "Candy Castle" space wins.
  - Game end screen displaying the winner.
- **User Interface (Web - Desktop):**
  - Clear visual representation of the game board, path, colors, and special locations.
  - Visual representation of player pawns on the board.
  - Interaction via mouse clicks (e.g., "Draw Card" button, "Start Game" button).
  - Display of the drawn card.
  - Basic visual feedback for pawn movement (e.g., pawn instantly appears on the new square, or a simple animation).
  - Display of player status (whose turn, any missed turns).
- **Technology:**
  - Backend logic implemented in Python 3.x.
  - Frontend delivered via HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - A standard Python web framework (e.g., Flask or Django) to serve the application and handle interactions.

**3.2. Out of Scope (Release 1.0):**

- AI / Computer-controlled opponents.
- Online multiplayer (player vs. player over the internet).
- User accounts, login, or persistent profiles.
- Saving and resuming game state.
- Mobile or tablet responsiveness/optimization.
- Advanced animations or sound effects.
- Variations of Candyland rules (e.g., different editions, house rules).
- Accessibility features beyond basic color contrast and legible text (e.g., screen reader support).
- Tutorials or rule explanations within the game interface (rules are assumed known or defined here).
- Chat functionality.
- Leaderboards or statistics tracking.

## 4. User Stories / Use Cases

**4.1. Player Setup:**

- **US1:** As a user visiting the website, I want to see an option to start a new Candyland game, so that I can begin playing.
- **US2:** As a user starting a new game, I want to select the number of players (2, 3, or 4), so that the game is set up correctly for my group.
- **US3:** As a player, I want to be automatically assigned a unique pawn (e.g., by color), so that I can easily identify my piece on the board.
- **US4:** As a player, I want the game to automatically determine the starting order of players (e.g., Player 1, Player 2, etc.), so that play can begin smoothly.

**4.2. Gameplay:**

- **US5:** As a player, I want to clearly see the entire Candyland game board, including the colored path, special locations, shortcuts, start, and finish, so that I understand the game state.
- **US6:** As a player, I want to see my pawn and the pawns of other players accurately positioned on the board, so that I know everyone's current progress.
- **US7:** As a player whose turn it is, I want the game interface to clearly indicate that it is my turn, so that I know when to act.
- **US8:** As the active player, I want to be able to click a "Draw Card" button, so that I can take my turn.
- **US9:** As a player, when a card is drawn, I want to clearly see the card that was drawn (e.g., single blue square, double orange square, Gumdrop Mountain picture), so that I understand the required move.
- **US10:** As a player, after drawing a card, I want the game to automatically move my pawn to the correct destination square according to the Candyland rules (next matching color, second matching color, or specific picture location), so that the game progresses correctly.
- **US11:** As a player, I want my pawn's movement to be visually represented on the board, so that I can follow the game's progress.
- **US12:** As a player, if I draw a card that moves my pawn to a "Lose a Turn" space (e.g., Molasses Swamp), I want the game to automatically skip my next turn and inform me, so that the rule is correctly applied.
- **US13:** As a player, if my pawn lands exactly on the starting space of a shortcut, I want the game to automatically move my pawn immediately to the end space of that shortcut, so that the rule is correctly applied.
- **US14:** As a player, I want the card deck to be automatically reshuffled and reused if all cards are drawn, so that the game can continue indefinitely until a winner is determined.

**4.3. Winning the Game:**

- **US15:** As a player, if my move takes my pawn to or past the final "Candy Castle" space, I want the game to immediately declare me the winner and end the game, so that the objective is achieved.
- **US16:** As a player, when the game ends, I want to see a clear message or screen indicating who won the game, so that the outcome is obvious.
- **US17:** As a user, after a game has ended, I want an option to start a new game, so that I can play again.

**4.4. Edge Cases:**

- **EC1:** Player draws a color card, but there are no more squares of that color between their current position and the finish. (Rule: Player stays put).
- **EC2:** Player draws a double color card, but there is only one square of that color left before the finish. (Rule: Player moves to that single square).
- **EC3:** Player pawn is on the space immediately before the "Lose a Turn" space, and draws a card that would land them on it. The "Lose a Turn" effect must trigger.
- **EC4:** Player pawn is positioned such that drawing a picture card moves them backward onto a shortcut start space. (Rule: Shortcuts only work if _landed_ upon by normal card draw movement, not by picture card movement _onto_ the start space. Verify standard rule - **Requirement: Assume shortcuts ONLY trigger on forward movement landing exactly on the start space**).
- **EC5:** Multiple pawns occupying the same space. (Rule: Allowed in Candyland).

**4.5. Accessibility Needs (Minimal for V1):**

- Use high-contrast colors for text, UI elements, and importantly, the board path squares.
- Ensure drawn card information is clearly legible (large text/icon).
- Use distinct visual identifiers for player pawns beyond just color if possible (e.g., simple shape variations).

## 5. Functional Requirements

**5.1. Game State Representation:**

- **FR1.1:** The system must maintain the state of the game, including:
  - Number of players (2-4).
  - Current position of each player's pawn on the board (indexed position on the path).
  - The current turn number.
  - The index of the player whose turn it is.
  - The state of the draw pile (remaining cards).
  - The state of the discard pile (cards already drawn).
  - A flag for each player indicating if they must skip their next turn (due to Molasses Swamp).
  - The game status (e.g., Setup, InProgress, Finished).
  - The winner (once determined).

**5.2. Board Representation:**

- **FR2.1:** The system must represent the Candyland board path as an ordered sequence of spaces.
- **FR2.2:** Each space in the sequence must have associated properties:
  - Index (position in the path, e.g., 0 to N-1, where N is total spaces).
  - Color (Red, Purple, Yellow, Blue, Orange, Green, or None/Special).
  - IsStartSpace (Boolean).
  - IsFinishSpace (Boolean).
  - IsPictureSpace (Boolean, with associated Picture Name, e.g., Gumdrop Mountain).
  - IsShortcutStart (Boolean, with target shortcut end index).
  - IsShortcutEnd (Boolean).
  - IsLoseTurnSpace (Boolean, e.g., Molasses Swamp).
- **FR2.3:** The sequence and properties must accurately reflect a standard Candyland board layout. (AI Agent: Use a standard layout; if ambiguity exists, use a common, verifiable online example. See Appendix for a potential reference).

**5.3. Card Deck:**

- **FR3.1:** The system must manage a deck of Candyland cards.
- **FR3.2:** The deck must contain the following standard cards (exact counts are crucial for game balance - based on a common edition):
  - 6x Red (Single)
  - 6x Purple (Single)
  - 6x Yellow (Single)
  - 6x Blue (Single)
  - 6x Orange (Single)
  - 6x Green (Single)
  - 2x Double Red
  - 2x Double Purple
  - 2x Double Yellow
  - 2x Double Blue
  - 2x Double Orange
  - 2x Double Green
  - 1x Peppermint Forest Picture Card
  - 1x Gumdrop Mountain Picture Card
  - 1x Lollipop Woods Picture Card
  - 1x Ice Cream Sea Picture Card
  - 1x Gingerbread Tree Picture Card
  - 1x Gloppy the Molasses Monster Picture Card (or equivalent)
  - _(Total: 44 cards. AI Agent: Verify this count against a standard reference if possible, but implement with these numbers)._
- **FR3.3:** At the start of the game, the deck must be shuffled into a random order to form the draw pile.
- **FR3.4:** The system must provide an action to draw the top card from the draw pile.
- **FR3.5:** The drawn card must be moved to the discard pile.
- **FR3.6:** If the draw pile becomes empty when a player needs to draw, the system must:
  1.  Take all cards from the discard pile.
  2.  Shuffle these cards thoroughly.
  3.  Make these shuffled cards the new draw pile.
  4.  Empty the discard pile.
  5.  Proceed with drawing the top card.

**5.4. Game Setup:**

- **FR4.1:** The system must present an interface allowing the user to select the number of players: 2, 3, or 4.
- **FR4.2:** Upon selection and confirmation (e.g., "Start Game" button), the system must initialize the game state:
  - Set the number of players.
  - Place each player's pawn at the designated start space (index 0). Assign unique identifiers/colors (e.g., Player 1 = Red Pawn, Player 2 = Blue Pawn, etc.).
  - Initialize and shuffle the card deck.
  - Set the current turn to Player 1.
  - Clear any "skip turn" flags.
  - Set the game status to "InProgress".

**5.5. Turn Management:**

- **FR5.1:** The system must clearly indicate which player's turn it is.
- **FR5.2:** Before allowing the current player to draw, the system must check if the player has a "skip turn" flag set.
  - If set, the system must clear the flag, display a message (e.g., "Player X loses a turn!"), and advance the turn to the next player.
  - If not set, the system must enable the "Draw Card" action for the current player.
- **FR5.3:** Upon completion of a player's move (after drawing and pawn movement), the system must advance the turn to the next player in sequence (Player 1 -> Player 2 -> ... -> Player N -> Player 1).

**5.6. Player Action: Draw Card:**

- **FR6.1:** The system must provide a mechanism (e.g., a button labeled "Draw Card") for the active player to initiate their turn. This mechanism must only be active for the player whose turn it is and who is not skipping a turn.
- **FR6.2:** Clicking "Draw Card" must trigger the drawing of one card from the draw pile (handling reshuffling if necessary per FR3.6).
- **FR6.3:** The drawn card must be clearly displayed to the user.
- **FR6.4:** The system must immediately calculate and execute the resulting pawn movement based on the drawn card (see FR7).

**5.7. Pawn Movement Logic:**

- **FR7.1:** **Single Color Card:**
  - Find the _first_ board space _after_ the pawn's current position that matches the drawn color.
  - Move the pawn to this space.
  - If no matching color space exists between the current position and the finish, the pawn does not move.
- **FR7.2:** **Double Color Card:**
  - Find the _first_ board space _after_ the pawn's current position that matches the drawn color.
  - Find the _second_ board space _after_ the pawn's current position that matches the drawn color.
  - Move the pawn to this _second_ matching space.
  - If only one matching color space exists before the finish, move to that space.
  - If no matching color spaces exist before the finish, the pawn does not move.
- **FR7.3:** **Picture Card:**
  - Find the board space designated for the specific picture shown on the card.
  - Move the pawn _directly_ to this space, regardless of its current position (this can be a forward or backward move).
- **FR7.4:** After any move, the system must check the pawn's new landing space for special conditions:
  - **Shortcut Start:** If the pawn lands _exactly_ on a space marked as IsShortcutStart (via FR7.1 or FR7.2 movement, NOT FR7.3 movement directly onto it), immediately move the pawn again to the corresponding shortcut end index. This second move does _not_ trigger further checks (e.g., if a shortcut ends on another special square).
  - **Lose a Turn Space:** If the pawn lands _exactly_ on a space marked as IsLoseTurnSpace, set the "skip turn" flag for that player to true. Display a message (e.g., "Player X landed on Molasses Swamp! Lose next turn.").
  - **Finish Space:** Check if the new position index is >= the index of the IsFinishSpace. If yes, trigger the win condition (FR8).

**5.8. Win Condition and Game End:**

- **FR8.1:** The game ends immediately when any player's pawn, after completing a move (including any shortcut taken), lands on or passes the final "Candy Castle" space (i.e., their position index >= finish space index).
- **FR8.2:** The first player to meet this condition is declared the winner.
- **FR8.3:** The system must change the game status to "Finished".
- **FR8.4:** The system must display a clear message or transition to a screen declaring the winner (e.g., "Player Y Wins!").
- **FR8.5:** All game actions (like drawing cards) must be disabled once the game is Finished.
- **FR8.6:** An option to "Play Again?" or "Start New Game" should be presented, which resets the game to the player selection screen (FR4.1).

**5.9. User Interface Elements:**

- **FR9.1:** **Game Board Display:** Visually render the board path, colors, special locations (labeled or visually distinct), shortcuts, start, and finish.
- **FR9.2:** **Pawn Display:** Show each player's uniquely identifiable pawn on its current board space. Multiple pawns can occupy the same space.
- **FR9.3:** **Player/Turn Info:** Display the list of players (e.g., "Player 1 (Red Pawn)"), and clearly highlight the currently active player. Show any status like "Misses Next Turn".
- **FR9.4:** **Card Area:**
  - A clickable "Draw Card" button, enabled only for the active player (if not skipping turn).
  - An area to display the most recently drawn card (image or description).
  - Visual representation of the draw pile (e.g., back of cards) and potentially the discard pile.
- **FR9.5:** **Feedback Messages:** Display temporary messages for key events (e.g., "Player 2 draws Double Blue!", "Player 1 takes the Rainbow Trail shortcut!", "Player 3 lands in Molasses Swamp!", "Shuffling discard pile...").

## 6. Non-functional Requirements

- **NFR1: Performance:**
  - UI interactions (button clicks) should register in < 200ms.
  - Pawn movement animation (if implemented) should be smooth, completing within 1 second. If no animation, update should be instantaneous (< 100ms).
  - Page load time for the game interface should be < 3 seconds on a standard desktop connection.
- **NFR2: Reliability:**
  - The game logic must be deterministic and free from race conditions or crashes during normal gameplay as defined in scope.
  - Target uptime is not critical for local play, but the application should be stable once loaded.
- **NFR3: Usability:**
  - The interface must be intuitive for users familiar with basic web navigation and the Candyland game. All clickable elements should be obvious.
  - Instructions should be minimal; gameplay should be self-evident from the UI components.
  - Must be playable using only a standard keyboard (if applicable, e.g., pressing Enter for Draw Card) and mouse. Primarily mouse-driven.
- **NFR4: Maintainability (Code Generation):**
  - Python code generated by the AI must be well-structured, using functions/methods and classes appropriately (e.g., `Game` class, `Player` class, `Board` class, `Card` class).
  - Code must be commented, especially for complex logic sections (movement calculations, state management).
  - Adherence to PEP 8 Python style guide.
  - Avoid hardcoding values where possible; use constants (e.g., for colors, picture names, board size).
  - Basic separation of concerns (e.g., game logic in Python backend, presentation in HTML/CSS/JS frontend).
- **NFR5: Security:**
  - As this is a local-only application with no user data persistence, security requirements are minimal.
  - Ensure no obvious vulnerabilities are introduced (e.g., if using a web framework, use standard practices to avoid XSS if displaying dynamic text, although input is limited here). No server-side storage of game state beyond the active session.
- **NFR6: Compatibility:**
  - Must function correctly on the latest versions of major desktop web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

**7.2. Key UI Elements Description:**

- **Board:** A visual depiction of the winding path. Use distinct background colors for squares. Special squares (pictures, shortcuts, lose-a-turn) should be visually distinct and potentially labeled. Pawns should be clearly visible on their squares. _AI Agent: You can use simple colored divs for squares initially. A background image could be used if provided._
- **Pawns:** Simple colored circles or gingerbread man icons. Must be easily distinguishable.
- **Player Info:** List players, their pawn color/identifier, and indicate whose turn it is (e.g., bold text, background highlight). Show "Misses Turn" status if applicable.
- **Draw Card Button:** A clear button, only active/clickable for the current player when it's their turn to draw.
- **Drawn Card Display:** An area where the image or description (e.g., "BLUE", "DOUBLE GREEN", "GUMDROP MOUNTAIN") of the drawn card is shown clearly after clicking Draw.
- **Message Area:** A space in the sidebar/status area to show game events (e.g., "Player 2 drew Red", "Player 1 won!").

**7.3. Game Setup Screen:**

- Simple page with text: "Welcome to Candyland!"
- Radio buttons or dropdown: "Select Number of Players:" (Options: 2, 3, 4)
- Button: "Start Game"

**7.4. Game End Screen:**

- Can overlay the main game screen or be a separate simple page.
- Large text: "Player X Wins!"
- Button: "Play Again?" (takes user back to Setup Screen).

---

## 8. Analytics & Tracking (Minimal for V1)

- **A1: Event - Game Started:** Track when a new game begins, including the number of players selected. (Log to console/server log).
- **A2: Event - Game Finished:** Track when a game ends, including which player won. (Log to console/server log).
- **A3: Event - Card Drawn:** Track the type of card drawn (Color Single, Color Double, Picture). Optional: track the specific color/picture. (Log to console/server log).
- **Tools:** Basic server-side logging or browser console logging is sufficient for V1. No third-party analytics integration required.

---

## 9. Dependencies

- **D1: Technology Stack:**
  - Python (Version 3.7+) for backend logic.
  - A Python web framework (Flask preferred due to simplicity, but Django acceptable) for serving the app.
  - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+) for the frontend presentation and interaction.
- **D2: Assets (To be Provided or Placeholder):**
  - Image for the game board background (optional, can be rendered with CSS).
  - Images for each type of card (Color cards, Picture cards). _AI Agent: If not provided, use colored squares/text descriptions._
  - Images or distinct visual styles for player pawns. _AI Agent: If not provided, use simple colored circles._
  - (Optional) Image for the back of the cards.
- **D3: Hosting:** Requires a standard Python web hosting environment if deployed publicly (out of scope for initial generation, but structure should allow it). Runs locally via the web framework's development server.

---

## 10. Assumptions

- **AS1:** The AI agent understands the rules of standard Candyland or can correctly interpret them from this document.
- **AS2:** The AI agent can generate functional Python code for game logic and integrate it with a basic web frontend using Flask/Django.
- **AS3:** "Desktop computer" implies screen resolutions typically >= 1024x768. The UI does not need to be responsive for smaller screens.
- **AS4:** "Hotseat" multiplayer means all players interact with the game on the same browser window, taking turns manually.
- **AS5:** Visual assets (images) will either be provided separately, or the AI should use functional placeholders (colored squares, text labels). Specify which approach to take if known. **Instruction:** _AI Agent, initially use functional placeholders (colored divs for squares, text/color for cards, simple shapes for pawns) unless specific asset paths are given._
- **AS6:** The standard ruleset referenced (card counts, specific picture locations, shortcuts) is acceptable. See Appendix for links if needed.

---

## 11. Risks & Mitigations

- **R1: Game Logic Errors:** Incorrect implementation of movement rules, win conditions, or special squares.
  - **Mitigation M1.1:** This highly detailed PRD.
  - **Mitigation M1.2:** AI Agent should generate unit tests for core functions (movement calculation for each card type, win condition check, deck shuffling/reshuffling).
  - **Mitigation M1.3:** Manual QA testing covering all card types, special squares, player counts, and win scenarios.
- **R2: User Interface Confusion:** Players cannot easily understand the game state or how to take their turn.
  - **Mitigation M2.1:** Follow the UX design description (Section 7) for clarity. Ensure current player indication, card display, and 'Draw Card' button are prominent.
  - **Mitigation M2.2:** Usability testing by target users (even informal).
- **R3: AI Misinterpretation:** AI Agent generates code that doesn't align with a specific requirement.
  - **Mitigation M3.1:** Unambiguous language used in this PRD. Explicit instructions provided.
  - **Mitigation M3.2:** Iterative generation and review. Test specific functionalities related to potentially ambiguous requirements early.
- **R4: Browser Incompatibility:** Game doesn't render or function correctly on a supported browser.
  - **Mitigation M4.1:** Use standard, widely supported HTML/CSS/JS features. Avoid experimental APIs.
  - **Mitigation M4.2:** Test on latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari during development/QA.
